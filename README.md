By: Sudhir Bhargava

Outside resources

Your list of outside resources go here: I mostly used class notes 

- I have attempted to extend project 3 by adding the "orders" database to the website
- Have created 2 primary database tables and 1 pivot table built with laravel within the database as follows:
	Primary tables:
	order
	tags
	Pivot table:
	order_tag
	
	CRUD - does not work
	
- Migrations and seeders used 
- barryvdh/laravel-debugbar installed
- I have been unable to make the database interact and commented out the associated code in my controller file
- No divergence from guidelines
